# CRUD API with JWT and RBAC

This repository contains a simple CRUD API implementation using JWT and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The API is developed in .NET and allows basic CRUD operations on a database. The use of JWT and RBAC ensures a high level of security and access control for the API.

## Technologies Used

- .NET
- Entity Framework
- LINQ
- SQL Server
- JWT
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Authentication and Authorization

This API uses JWT for authentication and RBAC for access control. Users must authenticate themselves with a valid JWT token before accessing any of the API's endpoints. The API also checks the user's role to determine whether they are authorized to perform a given action.
